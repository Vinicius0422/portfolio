Despite the challenges, we made significant progress, and the project is close to completion.\n\nMain technologies used: Java 11, Spring Boot, Angular 12, GitLab, and Docker.\n\nStarting in March 2025, I will join a new company, where I hope to gain more experience working in a team, working on large projects, and following best market practices.\n\nMain technologies I will be using in this new role: C#, .NET Core, React.js, Next.js, and Docker."
